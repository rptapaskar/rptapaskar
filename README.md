## About

I work at the intersection of **automation, robotics, embedded systems, applied AI, and energy systems**, with a strong focus on **research translation into deployable engineering systems**.

My work spans:
- Intelligent Industrial Automation
- Robotics & Human–Robot Collaboration
- Digital Twin–driven engineering workflows
- Embedded intelligence for energy and infrastructure systems
- Research-to-product pipelines in academia–industry settings

This GitHub serves as a **curated technical repository** of:
- Research frameworks
- Reference architectures
- Simulation pipelines
- Reproducible experiments
- Teaching + research enablement material

This is **not a collection of scripts**, but **system-level artifacts**.
